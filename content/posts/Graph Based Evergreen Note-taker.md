# Graph Based Evergreen Note-taker

#### Goals

- Visualize notes on canvas
  - show connections between notes that share tags or explicitly 
    link to each other

- Allow the underlying data structure to be manipulated by drag and drop of graph visuals

#### Toolkit

Gulp - Gulp ecosystem is full of great utilities which can be easily packaged together into 'tasks'. We can use gulp to watch files, transform markdown, CRUD files, etc. 

NanoEditor - My preexisting project, a react-based editor 

Canvas - Use react library like react-canvas or react-konva. Key advantage offered by canvas rendering is the ability to manipulate complex visual elements as bitmaps
